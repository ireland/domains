This repository will (eventually) maintain a list of regularly validated .ie domain names for research making ir easier to carry our research like the http archive web almanac but with an Irish focus.

I'm currently developing a process for collecting a representative list of domains and welcome any pointers in the rght direction.

Until then you can get an overview of the .ie domain space from the [iedr .ie domain report 2020/H1](https://www.weare.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IE-Domain-Registry-DP-Report-JanJun-2020.pdf)
