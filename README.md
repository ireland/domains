This repository will (eventually) maintain a list of regularly validated .ie domain names for research making it easier to carry our research like the [http archive web almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/) but with an Irish focus.

I'm currently developing a process for collecting a representative list of domains and welcome any pointers in the rght direction.

Until then you can get an overview of the .ie domain space from the iedr .ie domain report 2020/H1 [here (pdf download)](https://www.weare.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IE-Domain-Registry-DP-Report-JanJun-2020.pdf) and what shodan sees [here](https://www.shodan.io/report/FCHPkhMm)

This is a research project and all data is provided as is. If you encounter issues or bugs please raise them on the projects [github issues page](https://github.com/ireland/domains/issues)
